This project is convenient for people who want to get into open source and contribute to different projects especially during the Hacktoberfest.

*Don't hesitate to ask me for help on my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/nEDcagb), I would help you with great pleasure!*

## ü§ñ Add the bot on your server

You just need to click on [this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=761568927188123669&scope=bot&permissions=1141124160) and validate the form without changing any permission.

## üåê Adding a language

You can add languages to the robot so that it is translated and accessible to everyone!

To do this:
1. Open the file, e.g. with LibreOffice: `./app/lang/generated/all_translations_and_file_generator.ods`
1. Navigate to the sheet `Emojis and all languages` and please enhance it with more words or the language or emoji that you want to add and stick to the format of other entries (do not use capital letters) with the single quotes and separating different word (combinations) with a comma, e.g.: 
    * For a single trigger word: 'alien‚Äò 
    * For a single trigger word which consists of two words: 'black cat‚Äò 
    * Or for more than one word: 'alienmonster', 'monster' 
1. Navigate to the sheet `Document history` and add a row in which you shortly in English describe the changes that you have made in the style of the former entries. E.g. 
    * For a new languages: `Added words for language zh (Chinese).` 
    * Or for just adding words in an existing language: `Added more words to language en (English)`.
1. Save the spreadsheet file.
1. Navigate to the sheet `HowTo` and generate the new or updated language files (*.js, e.g. ‚Äúen.js‚Äú, ‚Äúes.js‚Äú or ‚Äúfr.js‚Äú, ‚Ä¶) in the directory of this spreadsheet file by clicking on the button `Create language files *.js` that calls a Basic macro which is generating the relevant JavaScript language files for the emojis.
    * *Hint:* If the button is not clickable you probably need to change the mode in which LibreOffice is:
        * In the menu bar click on ‚ÄúExtras‚Äú ‚Üí  ‚ÄúFormulars‚Äú ‚Üí ‚ÄúDraft mode‚Äú
1. Move the newly generated *.js file, e.g. "it.js", into the parent folder `./app/lang/`
1. Via git add the new *.js file, e.g. "it.js" in folder `./app/lang/` and also add the changes in the `./app/lang/generated/all_translations_and_file_generator.ods` file to your git feature branch and commit (+ push) it.
1. For the translation to be set up on the robot, do not hesitate to open a pull request by [following this guide](https://github.com/LucasCtrl/spookyBot/blob/main/README.md#-contributing).

You can see that the `emoji` element is an emoji, but you can also use a custom emoji. For that, I strongly advise you to [read this guide](https://discordjs.guide/popular-topics/reactions.html#custom-emojis).

## üíª Testing locally
1. Create a bot [on the Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications),
2. Create a webhook on your own discord server [by following this tutorial](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/discord_notifications.html),
3. Copy the `./app/config/config.example.json` from the project to `./app/config/config.json` and fill in the gaps with the information from the bot and the webhook. The first token is on the bot page accessed from the side of the Discord Developer Portal, and the webook information is found on the page when you navigate to the webhook url,
4. Invite your dev bot to your server by [following this url](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=761568927188123669&scope=bot&permissions=1141124160), replacing the client id with your bot's client id (found on it's general information page), and the permissions with the Permission Integer created in the Developer Portal as you select permissions for your bot,
5. Once these steps are setup, simply run `make startup_dev` from the terminal in the root directory of the repo,
5.1 If you want to install node modules you could just add it into your local package.json and run the `make build_dev_image` after that you need to recreate the container.
6. Test the bot is connected by running `<your-prefix>help` to get a list of commands, and then initialize the DB by running `<your-prefix>emitgc`. It should then respond with "Join <your-server> with <#> users,
7. Test that the bot reacts to comments by typing one of the words in `lang/<your-lang>.js`. The bot should respond with an emoji!
